/**
 * BAZ engagement tiers — project-based pricing, not SaaS subscriptions.
 * Each tier is a senior-led engagement with a clear scope, deliverable
 * shape, and indicative price range. Prices are USD, monthly retainer.
 *
 * Source-of-truth: derived from legacy `baz-legacy-v6/api/stripe.js` plans
 * (June 22, 2026) and adapted for BAZ's boutique project model.
 *
 * When `featured: true`, the tier is highlighted in the Pricing page.
 * When `cta: 'contact'`, the button links to /contact.
 * When `cta: 'external'`, the button opens the `externalUrl`.
