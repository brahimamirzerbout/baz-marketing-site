-- BAZ Marketing Agency — Fix existing tables + RLS policies
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL Editor for project fgjxkexgopllieggucws
-- The users and sessions tables already exist (from marketing-hub) but are
-- missing BAZ-specific columns. This adds them + creates RLS policies.

-- ── Add missing columns to users table ──
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS team TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS initials TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'BZ';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS color TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '#ff3b2f';

-- ── Add missing column to sessions table ──
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS id TEXT;
