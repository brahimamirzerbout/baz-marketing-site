## Style notes

- Display font: Inter (already self-hosted in `public/fonts/fraunces/`)
- Body font: Inter (already self-hosted in `public/fonts/inter/`)
- Mono font: JetBrains Mono (already self-hosted in `public/fonts/jetbrains-mono/`)
- Colors: `#22D3EE` accent, `#0e0e10` ink, `#020617` paper

If you open the HTML on a machine without these fonts, it'll fall back to Georgia / system-ui / ui-monospace. The deck still looks good — but for the printed PDF, use a machine that has the fonts.
