    title: "The junior mistake",
    years: "2021",
    body: 'We hired. Five juniors, a project manager, an account director. Revenue tripled in twelve months. Quality collapsed in six. The work went from "different" to "indistinguishable." Clients renewed out of habit, not conviction. We were profitable and we were empty.',
  },
  {
    n: "03",
    title: "The unwind",
    years: "2022",
    body: "We let the juniors go. We stopped pitching services we couldn't senior-staff. We cut the agency from 11 to 4 people. Revenue dropped 40%. It was the right move. The remaining clients stayed because they wanted what we actually were, not what we pretended to be.",
  },
  {
    n: "04",
    title: "The Hub",
    years: "2024",
    body: "We built the BAZ Marketing Hub because we were tired of writing the same monthly report by hand for the eighth time. The first version scored leads against touchpoints. The second routed them. The third stepped them through cadences. By the fourth, the whole loop ran without us. We realized we'd built the junior pipeline back — but as software.",
  },
  {
    n: "05",
    title: "Senior-only, by design",
    years: "2025",
    body: "Today BAZ is a four-person senior team with a Hub that does the busywork of a 30-person agency. We sell outcomes, not hours. We price on pipeline added, not bodies deployed. We publish our methodology, our scoring formula, and the code that runs the loop. Half the industry hedges. We don't.",
  },
  {
    n: "06",
    title: "What we won't do",
    years: "2026",
    body: "We won't enter awards. We won't pitch a service we can't senior-staff. We won't pretend a junior is a senior. We won't bill hours. We won't lock clients into contracts. We won't show a dashboard that's actually a screenshot. If you want any of those, we're not the right fit — and our /vs-others page says so.",

              Most agencies tell you they&apos;re senior. We show you the system that proves it. The
              Marketing Hub is open for clients to read, audit, and eventually own. The scoring
              formula is on the methodology page. The cadence logic is in our code. The data is

              they built in public. When you leave, you take the system with you. That&apos;s not a
              tagline. That&apos;s the whole pitch.
