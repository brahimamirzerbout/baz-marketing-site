/**
 * GET /api/services
 *
 * Returns the full 18-service catalog as JSON, suitable for:
 *   - third-party integrations (CRM product selectors, partner sites)
 *   - the operator console
 *   - the on-site search index (alternative to /api/search)
 *
 * Optional query params:
 *   ?pillar=owned|earned|paid|data|platform  → filter by channel
 *   ?format=summary                          → trim heavy fields (process, faqs)
 *   ?include=slug,name,pillar,...            → whitelist of fields to return
 *
 * No auth required — this is public marketing content.
