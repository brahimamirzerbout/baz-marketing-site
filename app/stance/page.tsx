              <li>
                <strong>Autonomous execution loops</strong> — the Marketing Hub scores leads, routes
                them, steps them, and reports outcomes without a human in the chain. That&apos;s
                leverage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning you can audit</strong> — every Nova answer comes with sources,
                confidence, and the SQL it ran. You can re-run it. Black boxes are junior behavior.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Senior judgment, accelerated</strong> — AI does the busywork so our partners
                spend time on positioning, creative, and client outcomes. That&apos;s where the
                leverage lives.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Source code, in the open</strong> — the Hub is built in public. Clients see
                the scoring formula, the attribution model, the cadences. Trust through
                transparency.

              <li>
                <strong>AI-generated creative presented as human work.</strong> If we used a model
                to draft a headline, we say so. Misattribution is a junior sin.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personalized outreach at scale without consent.</strong> Cold email + LLM is
                spam with a GPU. We don&apos;t do it. Sequences are opt-in only.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dashboards that look live but are screenshots.</strong> If we say it&apos;s
                live, it&apos;s live. The status card on the BAZventures homepage hits a real endpoint every
                60 seconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Black-box attribution.</strong> "AI figured it out" is not a measurement.
                Server-side events, named channels, weighted touchpoints. The math is open.

              We&apos;re not the finished article. We&apos;re publishing this so the next time a
              vendor pitches you &quot;AI-native,&quot; you can ask the three questions that matter:{" "}
              <em>What runs autonomously? What can you audit? What&apos;s the source?</em> If they
              can&apos;t answer in one sentence, they don&apos;t have it.

              The disagreement we welcome
            </h2>
            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If you think the senior-only model is wrong — if you believe a junior with the right
              prompts is a viable operating model — we&apos;d like to hear it. Not to argue, but to
              learn. The worst outcome is nobody having a position because everyone&apos;s hedging.
